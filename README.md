## Purpose of Project

This is first project that I built with using Next.js, TypeScript, and also Sanity.io. I want to get familiar with Next.js and TypeScript, and I do see guru on YouTube building their apps server on Sanity.io, rather than MongoDB or postgresql it is very interesting I want to try it out.  

It is very convenient to create and amend data on Sanity.io, even though it is using GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) language, I think it is a good CMS. 

This project just clone the layout of Medium for learning purpose, and I setup up all the post info in Sanity.io, others features such as authentication, din't included in this project.
